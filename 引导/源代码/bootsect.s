! SYS_SIZE is the number of clicks (16 bytes) to be loaded.

!	bootsect.s		(C) 1991 Linus Torvalds
!
! bootsect.s is loaded at 0x7c00 by the bios-startup routines, and moves
! iself out of the way to address 0x90000, and jumps there.
!
! It then loads 'setup' directly after itself (0x90200), and the system
! at 0x10000, using BIOS interrupts. 
!
! NOTE! currently system is at most 8*65536 bytes long. This should be no
! problem, even in the future. I want to keep it simple. This 512 kB
! kernel size should be enough, especially as this doesn't contain the
! buffer cache as in minix
!
! The loader has been made as simple as possible, and continuos
! read errors will result in a unbreakable loop. Reboot by hand. It
! loads pretty fast by getting whole sectors at a time whenever possible.
